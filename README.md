Part 1


## 1. Simple Linear Regression
In this dataset we are looking at dataset titled Wine by UC Irvine.
Our first steps include importing over all the packages you need. 
Which are: 
import pandas as pd
import pandas as pd
import statsmodels.api as sm
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from scipy import stats

from statsmodels.stats.diagnostic import linear_rainbow
from scipy.stats import shapiro
from statsmodels.stats.diagnostic import het_goldfeldquandt

And then the dataset had an option that let us import in python following the instructions they had, I was able to import. And I did df to see I had 178 row and 13 columns.
